# Github-Search

#### This website is the GitHub Search App website, 09/12/2019

#### By **Koshin Mohamed**

## Description

Github-Search App is an app where users can enter a GitHub username or repositories into a form, submit it, and see names and descriptions of that person's public repositories.

## BDD

When the user enters the website they enter the landing page. Once they go through to the main page there is a search bar where they can search GitHub by either user or repository.

Then the users Github information and Repos are displayed below.

The user can further click the links to go to the actual Github page for further detail viewing.
